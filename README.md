Udacity Code Reviewer:
Great recommendations for a novice programmer like me.
The more I code , the more I like swift.
Thanks for the motivation.

Used few udacity Reviewer code improvement tips.

Introduced Folder structure overall, removed same code & added "Swipe to Delete" feature in the List View of Sent Memes.

ImageView was blank . Problem was my object was "Nil" when passing data.

Stuck on Linking Storyboard UIView Collections & List properly. // Solved this problem.

Can't understand Appdelegate Shared instance & array struct properly instances everywhere. // Trying to understand

AppDelegate shared instance day by day. // Learning day by day.

Properly understood Collection View & Table view methods to initiate.

Not cleared with which class & identifier goes where. Sometimes it gets confusing. // Storyboard Linking is now bit easy.


Practise will surely improve my skills.
