# MemeMe-1

Working on MemeMe 2.0

Stuck on Linking Storyboard UIView Collections & List properly. // Solved this problem.

Can't understand Appdelegate Shared instance & array struct properly instances everywhere. // Trying to understand AppDelegate shared instance day by day.
Properly understood Collection View & Table view methods to initiate.
Not cleared with which class & identifier goes where. Sometimes it gets confusing. // Storyboard Linking is now bit easy.


Practise will surely improve my skills.
